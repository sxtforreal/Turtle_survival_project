# Cross-disciplinary Research Project: Investigate the Survival Rate of Turtles

### Introduction

The Algonquin turtle life history project focuses on finding out related factors to the life span of turtles. The researchers camp in Algonquin park to observe and record these turtles. Once a turtle is captured and measured, a unique notch is placed onto their shells for tracking purposes. Raw data of 42 variables are provided. Researchers believe that survival rate of painted turtle is low in juvenile phase but increase with age. The reason is that their sizes and defences grow with age. 

According to some research findings, we can get a glimpse of some of the characteristics of painted turtles: There are about 400 painted turtles in Algonquin park, more of them adults than juveniles; Turtles emerge in May, nest between June and July, hatch between August and September; Female painted turtles are generally bigger than male while male has longer claws; Turtles grow after maturity throughout their entire life. 

The research question is: **what are the significant factors that contribute to the life span of turtles.**

### Methods
1. Applied Spatial Data Analysis to explore geographical variation across multiple species and quantify the spatial effect on survival
2. Implemented ARIMA Time Series Analysis Model to explore the trend and systematic pattern in survival data over time
3. Conducted Survival Analysis with the Open-population Cormack-Jolly-Seber Model, successfully identified eight significant factors from more than fifty exposures
